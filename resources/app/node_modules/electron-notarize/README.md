## What is app "notarization"?

From apple's docs, the definition of a "notarized app"

> A notarized app is a macOS app that was uploaded to Apple for processing before it was distributed. When you export a notarized app from Xcode, it code signs the app with a Developer ID certificate and staples a ticket from Apple to the app. The ticket confirms that you previously uploaded the app to Apple.

> On macOS 10.14 and later, the user can launch notarized apps when Gatekeeper is enabled. When the user first launches a notarized app, Gatekeeper looks for the appâ€™s ticket online. If the user is offline, Gatekeeper looks for the ticket that was stapled to the app.

Basically Apple are going to make this a hard requirement soon, may as well get
on the train early.

## API

### Method: `notarize(opts): Promise<void>`

* `options` Object
  * `appBundleId` String - The app bundle identifier your Electron app is using.  E.g. `com.github.electron`
  * `appPath` String - The absolute path to your `.app` file
  * `appleId` String - The username of your apple developer account
  * `appleIdPassword` String - The password for your apple developer account

#### Safety when using `appleIdPassword`

1. Never hard code your password into your packaging scripts, use an environment
variable at a minimum.
2. It is possible to provide a keychain reference instead of your actual password.  E.g.

```js
const password = `@keychain:"Application Loader: ${appleId}"`;
```

#### Example Usage

```js
import { notarize } from 'electron-notarize';

async function packageTask () {
  // Package your app here, and code side with hardened runtime
  await notarize({
    appBundleId,
    appPath,
    appleId,
    appleIdPassword,
  });
}
```
